== 6.4.      Service Type

The OGC WMS Implementation Specification defines two conformance
classes, “Basic WMS” and “Queryable WMS”. A Basic WMS supports the
GetCapabilities and GetMap operations (requests and responses); a
Queryable WMS includes all Basic WMS operations and an additional
GetFeatureInfo operation.

::
*_Requirement 1: A DGIWG WMS server shall be compliant to the Queryable WMS conformance class._*

According to this requirement a DGIWG WMS server shall support the
GetCapabilities, GetMap and GetFeatureInfo operations. This requirement
ensures compatibility with the base standard.
