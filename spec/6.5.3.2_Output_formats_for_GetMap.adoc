==== 6.5.3.2.  Output formats for GetMap requests

The response to a GetMap request is either a raster or vector file.

::
*_Requirement 5: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the following raster formats for the GetMap operation:_*
* *_image/png (Portable Network Graphics)_*
* *_image/gif (Graphics Interchange Format)_*
* *_image/jpeg (Joint Photographics Expert Group)_*

::
*_Recommendation 1: If a service requires vector based graphical elements output, a DGIWG WMS server should provide image/svg+xml (Scalable Vector Graphics) for the GetMap operation._*

*_NOTE: Users should be aware that only the output formats GIF and PNG
support transparency._*
